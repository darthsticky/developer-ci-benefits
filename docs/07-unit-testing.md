# Unit Tests

Unit Tests test small blocks (units or functions) of code to ensure result of the tested unit of code is what it's expected to be.
Unit tests provide a lot of help with CI. They define code quality and provide developers with feedback without having to push/merge/host code.

----

> Unit tests are in the [Testing Code](what-is-ci.md) category of CI.

## Unit Testing Example

The example below is a unit test provided purely by the browser!

### A TypeScript Aside

The function below is written in TypeScript initially. This is done so _hopefully_, a potential failure is clear
_(The function expects a number)_. TypeScript helps define a code's interface.
 After writing the code below in TypeScript, a text editor can be configured to quickly communicate to a developer if it is working as expected.

```typescript

const addsOne = (num: number) => num + 1

```

----

Here's an es6 or es5 version of the same method.
This code (below) is what the TypeScript above will be or would be compiled into.

```javascript

// es6
const addsOne = (num) => num + 1
// es5
function addsOne (num) { return num + 1 }

```

Using a browser, this method can be unit tested using `console.assert`. Read more about [console.assert](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/assert).

```javascript

const addsOne = (num) => num + 1
const numPlus1 = addsOne(3)
const stringNumPlus1 = addsOne('3')

/**
 * console.assert
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/assert
 * @param test?
 * @param string
 * @returns string if the test fails
 */

console.assert(numPlus1 === 4, 'The variable `numPlus1` is not 4!')
console.assert(stringNumPlus1 === 4, 'The variable `stringNumPlus1` is not 4!')

```

The unit test above catches a problem! If the `num` argument is a string the function fails and provides the `error message` _'The variable \`stringNumPlus1\` is not 4!'_.

An engineer can now decide how to change, fix or not fix the function.

----

`Console.assert` was used to display how unit testing can be done without any libraries.
However, frameworks like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) are often used to describe how code that will be compiled for production should function. This important to note because tests can run within a text editor as you code using tools like [Quokka](https://quokkajs.com/). Quokka can test code as it is written, log code via comment asserts, and communicate code that is testsâ€”or untested!
